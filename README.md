- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **NLP-based research**, **block-chain and/or web developement based projects**.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **optimizing machine learning model performance** and **exploring advanced deep learning techniques**.   
- 📫 How to reach me: **email**: [khyatisingh.tech@gmail.com] | **LinkedIn**: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/khyatz/]  
- 😄 Pronouns: **she/they**
